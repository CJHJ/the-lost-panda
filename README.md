# The Lost Panda

## Description

A simple endless running game built for a particular school assignment in 2015. The backend server is developed over Node.js (modified over the OpenShift sample application, hence the weird comments), and the game itself is a CreateJS-based JavaScript game. The website is a Single Page Application, using AngularJS modal dialogs for navigations.

## Requirements

```
node 0.6.0 and above
express 3.4.4
MongoDB 2.0.39 and above
```

## Running

Start the MongoDB ```mongod``` server and then run ```node server.js``` at project root directory. Make sure to allow CORS in advance. You might be able to do this by using [Moesif CORS extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) in Google Chrome.

## Disclaimer
